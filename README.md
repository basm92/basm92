## Bas Machielsen ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my [github profile](http://www.github.com/basm92)! My name is Bas Machielsen, and I am a PhD student specializing in economic history at Utrecht University. 

My favorite programming languages are R, in which I have experience developing some low-key Shiny apps and packages, as well as Python, about which I am still very actively learning. I also have some elementary knowledge of HTML and CSS. 

In my spare time, I also like to dabble in web design, and I love learning to integrate my web tools usign the aforementioned programming languages. If you 

- have any questions, or 
- ðŸ‘¯ want to work with me on (almost) literally anything, please feel free to contact me. 

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on several economic history related projects. Feel free to take a look at [my website](http://bas-m.netlify.app) if you want to know more.
