## Bas Machielsen ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my [Github Profile](http://www.github.com/basm92)! My name is Bas Machielsen, and I am a PhD student specializing in economic history at Utrecht University (the Netherlands). My favorite programming languages are R, in which I have experience developing some low-key Shiny apps and packages, as well as Python, about which I am still very actively learning. I also have some elementary knowledge of HTML and CSS. 

In my spare time, I also like to dabble in web design, and I love learning to integrate my web tools usign the aforementioned programming languages. If you..
