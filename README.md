## Bas Machielsen ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my [Github Profile](http://www.github.com/basm92)! My name is Bas Machielsen, and I am a PhD student specializing in economic history at Utrecht University (the Netherlands). My favorite programming languages are R, in which I have experience developing some low-key Shiny apps and packages, as well as Python, about which I am still very actively learning. I also have some elementary knowledge of HTML and CSS. 

In my spare time, I also like to dabble in web design, and I love learning to integrate my web tools using the aforementioned programming languages. If you.. 

- have any questions, or 
- want to work with me on (almost) anything
- or feel like having a chat

..please feel free to contact me! I would especially love to work on research or data science-related projects, but I (think I) am interested in many things!

## Iâ€™m currently working on..

Several economic history-related projects, among which is my (future) job market paper! Feel free to take a look at [my website](http://bas-m.netlify.app) if you want to know more.

## Iâ€™m currently learning.. ðŸŒ±

I am slowly trying to improve my efficiency in Python, and I am trying to learn the basics of Julia!

## Iâ€™m looking for help with ...

Anything I am learning about!

## ðŸ’¬ Ask me about ...

Anything, but especially, my other hobby, languages! I love to (attempt to) speak French, Russian, English, German, Dutch or Turkish (not necessarily in order of preference!)
