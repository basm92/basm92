## Bas Machielsen ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my [Github Profile](http://www.github.com/basm92)! My name is Bas Machielsen, and I am a PhD student specializing in economic history at Utrecht University (the Netherlands). My favorite (and most-used) programming languages are R, in which I have experience developing some low-key Shiny apps and packages, as well as Python. I also have some elementary knowledge of Stata, HTML, CSS, and bash. In my spare time, I also like to dabble in web design, and I love learning to integrate my web tools using the aforementioned programming languages. 

## Iâ€™m currently working on..

Several economics and economic history-related projects, among which is my (future) job market paper! Feel free to take a look at [my website](http://bas-m.netlify.app) if you want to know more.
