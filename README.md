## Bas Machielsen 

Welcome to my [Github Profile](http://www.github.com/basm92)! My name is Bas Machielsen, and I am an assistant professor in Applied Economics at Utrecht University (Netherlands). I specialize in economic history and political economy, and I am also interested in data science and deep learning methods for data curation. My favorite (and most-used) programming languages are R and Python, in which I have a lot of applied but also some development experience. I also have some elementary knowledge of bash, and web design. 

## I’m currently working on..

Several economics projects about historical political economy! Feel free to take a look at [my website](http://bas-m.netlify.app) if you want to know more.
